How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  Interpreting user requirments requires taking what the user wants to happen and put that into a context that the developers can use
  to code effective code. User stories naturally make this process easier as the context is presupposed in the concept which enforces
  that concept of required context.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  One of the most powerful I would incoporate into software development would be the aformentioned user stories. One of the biggest 
  confusion I see is in that translating of requirements into actionable targets for the developers to aim for. Providing the correct
  thing to aim for at the onset can remove alot of discuragement that the developers incur during the development process.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Being a good team member in software development is similiar if not identical to any other team pursuit. Being open to critisism, 
  providing frank and timely feedback, supporting other team mates, and holding them accountable when they do make the mark are all
  hallmarks of a good team member but also the ability to not overcorrect with any of those traits. Unlimited support, feedback, or 
  calls for accountability might not be the appropriate response and requires a deft touch to truely succeed in being a good team
  mate.
